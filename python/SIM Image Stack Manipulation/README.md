This codes purpose is hopefully semi self explanatory in the file names.
All the code is for performing different separation, and shuffling tasks on image stacks. Specifically multi and and multiphase SIM image stacks, and MF-SIM image stacks.

The shuffleMyStack.ipynb notebook calls the combine_stacks.py
to reorganize and scale synthetic MF_SIM data for final reconstruction.
